# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Decided on working on 100 Days of Code Challenge. Will work on various datasets and tools that I have wanted to work on but didn't due to various reasons (read lazy :).

**Thoughts:** I don't know if I am going to make it, but I will give it my best.
