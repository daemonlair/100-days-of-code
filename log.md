# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Decided on working on 100 Days of Code Challenge. Will work on various datasets and tools that I have wanted to work on but didn't due to various reasons (read lazy :).

**Thoughts:** I don't know if I am going to make it, but I will give it my best.

### Day 01: June 26, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Working on ROS based Projects with Deep Learning Technology

**Thoughts:** ROS is a really useful and fun software. There are multiple additional softwares that can be used such as Gazebo, Unity etc. I want to be able to write plugins to other softwares for ROS. Need to learn more for that :)
